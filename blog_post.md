## Creating our own Kubernetes and Docker to run our data infrastructure

At Modal Labs, we've taken an unconventional approach to running our data infrastructure. Instead of relying on existing container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, we decided to create our own custom solution. This decision was driven by our unique needs and the desire for greater control over our infrastructure.

Our custom solution combines elements of both Kubernetes and Docker, tailored specifically for our data processing requirements. By building our own system, we've been able to optimize for our particular use cases and achieve better performance and resource utilization.

Some key aspects of our custom infrastructure include:

1. Containerization: Like Docker, we use containerization to package and isolate our applications and dependencies.
2. Orchestration: We've implemented our own orchestration layer to manage container deployment, scaling, and networking.
3. Resource allocation: Our system includes custom algorithms for efficient resource allocation across our cluster.
4. Monitoring and logging: We've integrated purpose-built monitoring and logging solutions to provide visibility into our infrastructure.

While creating our own Kubernetes and Docker-like system has required significant investment, it has paid off in terms of efficiency and flexibility. This approach has allowed us to fine-tune our infrastructure to meet the specific demands of our data processing workloads.

By sharing our experience, we hope to inspire other companies to consider innovative approaches to their infrastructure challenges. Sometimes, building a custom solution can provide advantages that off-the-shelf products cannot match.




## Building your own Kubernetes and Docker

When it comes to containerization and orchestration technologies, Kubernetes and Docker are two of the most popular and powerful tools available. In this section, I'll guide you through the process of building your own Kubernetes and Docker setup.

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that can run anywhere, making it easier to develop and deploy applications consistently across different environments.

Kubernetes, on the other hand, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust framework for running distributed systems resiliently.

To build your own Kubernetes and Docker environment, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Docker on your local machine or server.
2. Set up a Kubernetes cluster, either locally using tools like Minikube or on a cloud platform.
3. Configure your container images and push them to a container registry.
4. Define your application's deployment, services, and other resources using Kubernetes YAML files.
5. Apply these configurations to your Kubernetes cluster using kubectl commands.
6. Monitor and manage your applications using Kubernetes' built-in tools and dashboards.

By building your own Kubernetes and Docker setup, you'll gain valuable hands-on experience with these powerful technologies and be better equipped to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.




## I'm Erik Bernhardsson

Hello, I'm Erik Bernhardsson, the founder of Modal Labs. You may know me from my work building the music recommendation system at Spotify. I'm also active on social media - you can find me on Twitter @bernhardsson where I tweet occasionally. For more in-depth thoughts, I blog very occasionally at https://erikbern.com.

A bit about my background: I have extensive experience in building large-scale machine learning systems, particularly in the music and recommendation space. At Spotify, I led the development of their core music recommendation engine, which powers features like Discover Weekly and Radio. This work involved tackling challenging problems in collaborative filtering, content-based recommendation, and scalable machine learning.

Now, as the founder of Modal Labs, I'm focused on building tools to make machine learning and artificial intelligence more accessible and easier to deploy. Modal provides a cloud platform for running machine learning models and AI applications with minimal infrastructure overhead.

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and insights from my experiences in the tech industry. That's why I maintain an active presence on Twitter and write occasional long-form blog posts. On Twitter, I often share quick thoughts on tech trends, machine learning developments, and startup life. My blog allows me to dive deeper into technical topics and provide more comprehensive analyses.

I hope you'll check out some of my work and connect with me online. I'm always eager to engage in discussions about machine learning, recommendation systems, startups, and the future of AI. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about these topics!




## All just wanted to make data teams more productive!

In this section, I'd like to discuss some key aspects of making data teams more productive. There are several important areas to focus on:

1. How to productionize jobs: This involves taking data processing and analysis tasks from development to production-ready systems that can run reliably and efficiently.

2. How to scale things out: As data volumes and processing requirements grow, it's crucial to understand techniques for scaling your data infrastructure and algorithms to handle larger workloads.

3. Scheduling things: Effective job scheduling is essential for managing complex data pipelines and ensuring tasks run at the right time and in the correct order.

4. How to use GPUs and other hardware: Leveraging specialized hardware like GPUs can significantly accelerate certain types of data processing and machine learning tasks.

These areas are all interconnected and contribute to the overall goal of increasing data team productivity. By mastering these aspects, teams can build more robust, efficient, and scalable data systems.

It's worth noting that productivity isn't just about working faster â€“ it's about working smarter. Sometimes, diving deep into a problem (like a rabbit in a burrow) is necessary to find the best solution. The key is to balance thorough analysis with practical implementation.

By focusing on these areas, data teams can streamline their workflows, reduce bottlenecks, and ultimately deliver more value to their organizations.




## What do I mean by eng productivity

When I talk about engineering productivity, I'm referring to a set of nested for-loops involved in writing code. This process can be visualized as a diagram showing the iterative nature of software development.

The outermost loop represents the overall development cycle. Within this, we have inner loops that represent the process of writing code, running it, and fixing any issues that arise. This cycle repeats until the desired functionality is achieved.

At the core of this process is the actual act of writing code. However, productivity isn't just about how fast you can type. It's about how efficiently you can move through these loops, minimizing the time spent on each iteration while maximizing the quality of the output.

The key to improving engineering productivity lies in optimizing each of these loops. This might involve using better tools, implementing more efficient processes, or improving code quality to reduce the need for fixes. By focusing on these aspects, we can significantly enhance the overall productivity of our engineering efforts.
